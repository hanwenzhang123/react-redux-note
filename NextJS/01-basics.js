The React Framework for Production
- React: you will write React code, you still build React components and use React features (props, state, context...)
        NextJS just enhances your react app and adds more features
- Framework: Lots of built-in features (e.g. routing) that help you solve common problems & clear guidance on how to use those features
- Production: There are certain problems which you will need to solve for almost all production-ready React apps

NextJS Key Features & Benefits
- Server-side Rendering
  Automatic page pre-rendering: Great for SEO and initial load
  Blending client-side and server-side: fetch data on the server and render finished pages
- File-based Routing
  Define pages and routes with files and folders instead of code
  Less code, less work, highly understandable
- Fullstack Capabilities
  Easily add backend (server-side) code to your Next/React apps
  Storing data, getting data, authentication etc, can be added to your react projects
